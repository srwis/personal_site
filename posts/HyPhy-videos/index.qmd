As part of my time as a postdoc at IGEM in Temple University, I recorded a series of youtube video for the [HyPhy](https://hyphy.org/) software package. 

This video describe how to use BUSTED[S], a model I developed in graduate school while at NCSU. The paper for which can be read [here](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/37/8/2430/5739973?login=false).
